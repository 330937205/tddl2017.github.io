title: 1st Workshop on Temporal Dynamics in Digital Libraries
---

# CALL FOR PAPERS

In Digital Libraries, which can often span several epochs, time is a critical factor. It is the means by which understanding, searching, and exploring these collections of data.
Temporal dynamics, i.e. time-based patterns and trends, underpin language usage, entity references, and cultural and economic trends. Users accessing the information contained in Digital Libraries have to deal with their partial knowledge of these phenomena (word meaning variation, entity temporal ambiguity, specific events and time-related trends), as well as their own temporal evolution, i.e. their change in interests, preferences, and goals over time. Intercepting, representing, and predicting these dynamics is fundamental to the intelligent information access in Digital Libraries.
This workshop proposes to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds in order to identify and discuss research trends, challenges, and new opportunities related to the time-aware intelligent access to Digital Libraries.

# HOW TO SUBMIT

* Short paper: 4 pages
* Demos: 4 pages
* Long papers: between 8 and 12 pages
* Paper format: according to the main conference format [Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0)
* EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tddl2017](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tddl2017)

We encourage submissions that describe new theoretical models, applied techniques, and research in progress.
Submissions should not have been published or submitted for publication elsewhere and should be prepared according to the main conference format (Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science).
All submissions should be written in English and submitted as PDF.
Submissions will be peer reviewed (single-blind) by the program committee members.
Evaluation criteria will include novelty, significance for theory/practice, technical soundness, and quality of presentation.
All the submissions should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tddl2017).
At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work.
The accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings via CEUR Workshop Proceedings.
We will also consider editing a special issue on the International Journal on Digital Libraries after the workshop by encouraging the participants to extend their papers.
