title: 1st Workshop on Temporal Dynamics in Digital Libraries
subtitle: at  21st International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries

# CALL FOR PAPERS

In Digital Libraries, which can often span several epochs, time is a critical factor. It is the means by which understanding, searching, and exploring these collections of data.
Temporal dynamics, i.e. time-based patterns and trends, underpin language usage, entity references, and cultural and economic trends. Users accessing the information contained in Digital Libraries have to deal with their partial knowledge of these phenomena (word meaning variation, entity temporal ambiguity, specific events and time-related trends), as well as their own temporal evolution, i.e. their change in interests, preferences, and goals over time. Intercepting, representing, and predicting these dynamics is fundamental to the intelligent information access in Digital Libraries.
This workshop proposes to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds in order to identify and discuss research trends, challenges, and new opportunities related to the time-aware intelligent access to Digital Libraries.

# INVITED SPEAKER

## Taking Time Seriously: Diachronic Collections in Digital Libraries
by ***Jaap Kamps***, University of Amsterdam

Digital library collections may appear static, but usually contains content from many different time periods.  What changes when your collection is a diachronic corpus spanning decades or even centuries?  The temporal structure is a lightweight annotation that provides powerful new handles for users to explore the collection, and engage with the material from many different angles.  There are also fundamental consequences for the design of digital library systems and back office systems empowering curators and digital humanities researchers to explore the data at scale.  We study this question for collections of parliamentary proceedings spanning multiple centuries in a uniform format.

***About the speaker:*** Jaap Kamps is an associate professor of information retrieval at the University of Amsterdam, PI of a stream of large research projects on information access funded by NWO and the EU, vice-chair of the ACM SIG-IR, organizer of evaluation efforts at TREC and CLEF, and a prolific organizer of conferences and workshops.  His research interests span all facets of information storage and retrieval -- from user-centric to system-centric, and from basic research to applied research. A common element is the combination of textual information with additional structure, such as document structure, Web-link structure, and/or contextual information, such as meta-data, anchors, tags, clicks, or profiles.
